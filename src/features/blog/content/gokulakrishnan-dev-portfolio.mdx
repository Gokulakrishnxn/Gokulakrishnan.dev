# Building My AI-Powered Portfolio: A Journey Through Modern Web Development

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm excited to share the story behind [gokulakrishnan.dev](https://gokulakrishnan.dev) - a modern, AI-powered portfolio that showcases my work as an AI Engineer and Researcher.

## The Vision

When I set out to build my portfolio, I wanted to create something that truly represents who I am: an AI Engineer passionate about Machine Learning, Large Language Models, and creating exceptional user experiences. The goal was to build a portfolio that's not just a showcase of my work, but an interactive experience that demonstrates my technical skills.

## Key Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Chatbot (Tessa)

One of the standout features of this portfolio is **Tessa**, my AI assistant powered by Google Gemini. Tessa helps visitors learn about my background, projects, skills, and achievements in a conversational way. Built with:

- **Google Gemini API** for intelligent responses
- **React** for smooth, interactive UI
- **Real-time conversation** handling with proper context management
- **Error handling** and timeout protection for reliability

Tessa can answer questions about my education at Hindustan University Chennai, my role as Technical Lead of Blue Screen Programming Club, my projects, awards, and more.

### 🎨 Modern Tech Stack

This portfolio is built with cutting-edge technologies:

- **Next.js 16** (App Router) - For server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **TypeScript** - For type-safe, maintainable code
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - For modern, responsive styling
- **React 19** - For the latest React features
- **shadcn/ui** - For beautiful, accessible components

### 📦 Component Registry

I've created a custom component registry system that allows developers to easily install and use my components via the shadcn CLI. This includes:

- Reusable UI components
- Custom React hooks
- Pre-built blocks and sections
- Utility functions

All components are compatible with Tailwind CSS v4 and React 19, ensuring they work seamlessly in modern projects.

### 📝 Blog System

The portfolio includes a full-featured blog system with:

- **MDX support** - Write blog posts with Markdown and React components
