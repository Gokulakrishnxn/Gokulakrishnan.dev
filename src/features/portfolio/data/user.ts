  about: `

Hey 👋🏻! I'm Gokulakrishnan, an AI Engineer and Researcher from Chennai, passionate about Machine Learning and Large Language Models.
I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's in AI and Data Science at Hindustan University. Recently, I published my research at the IEEE International Conference in Singapore and received the Best Paper Award in AI and Robotics for my work on Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Decentralised Drone Swarm Exploration.

**What I Do**
I've been freelancing for 3 years, delivering 40+ projects in web and full-stack development. For the past two years, I've focused on building AI agents, chatbots, and voicebots for clients.
As Technical Lead of the Blue Screen Programming Club, I organized Innothon 2025 with 1000+ participants.

**Hackathon Wins**
4th Place — OpenAI Academy X NxtWave Buildathon (1000 participants)
Second Runner-Up — IBM Mindscape Hackathon

I'm always excited to collaborate on innovative AI projects. Let's connect!
