Hey 👋🏻! I'm Gokulakrishnan, an AI Engineer and Researcher from Chennai, India, passionate about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Large Language Models.

**Education & Research**
I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech. in Computer Science with a specialization in AI & Data Science at Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science, Chennai (CGPA: 8.26/10). My research focuses on Federated Learning, NLP, and Multi-Agent Systems. I recently published my research at the IEEE International Conference in Singapore (2025) and received the **Best Paper Award** for my work on "Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework for Decentralized Drone Swarm Exploration."

**Professional Experience**
Currently working as an **AI Engineer Intern** at The Binary Holdings, where I'm developing Buddy.ai—a sentiment-aware 3D avatar chatbot providing real-time emotional support using empathetic NLP techniques. I've integrated 3D animated characters with dynamic lip-sync and micro-expressions, designed low-latency full-stack architectures, and implemented ethical AI guardrails for mental health applications.

**Technical Expertise**
I specialize in **Python, R, JavaScript, Node.js** for development, with deep expertise in **TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas** for AI/ML. I'm proficient in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Federated Learning**, and have hands-on experience with **Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Vercel, Docker, Git, CI/CD**. I work with databases including **Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime APIs)** and **MongoDB**.

**Achievements & Leadership**
- 🏆 **Best Paper Award** - IEEE International Conference, Singapore 2025
- 🥇 **4th Place** - OpenAI Academy × NxtWave Buildathon (competed against 1,000+ teams)
- 👨‍💼 **Technical Lead** - Blue Screen Programming Club (2024-2025)
  - Hosted Innothon 2025 CodeArena with 1,000+ participants
  - Organized multiple technical events and hands-on workshops

**Projects & Research**
My notable projects include REX Healthify (AI Health Assistant), which secured 4th place in the OpenAI × NxtWave Buildathon, and my research on Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Drone Swarm Exploration, which won the Best Paper Award at IEEE International Conference, Singapore 2025.

I'm always excited to collaborate on innovative AI projects, research, and open-source contributions. Let's connect!
